# In this page I have set up a user story for future use.

These are used to determine what should be implemented into our application.

## In the case of the idea for my application, I define a user as someone who:

- **Wants to reduce the burden of having to remember a large amount of information.**

## Userstory for future work.
- **As a user i want to be able to have my settings rememberd so i can use the application immediatly.**
