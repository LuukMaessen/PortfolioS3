## Intro
Welcome to my portfolio of Semester 3 on Fontys HBO ICT. 
This portfolio is a collection of all my work during this Semester.
It will include the projects, code and documentation from both my Individual Project and the Group Project.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my personal achievements of this semester, which are necessary to fulfill the learning outcomes.

## Personal Learning Outcome Rating
This is a personal  reflection on the learning outcomes for this semester.
Under here is a table where I give myself a rating on each of the learning outcomes and a clarification.

|Learning Outcome|Rating|Clarification|
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
|Web Application|proficient|**Userfriendly**: <br/>To make our group project as userfriendly as possible we've looked at a lot of other applications to see how they manage their UX. <br/> <br/> **Fullstack**:<br/> I've designed and built our application with a React front-end, and 2 back-end services (Employee-API and User-API), my project uses external api's and services from google for authentication|
|Software Quality|proficient|**Tooling and Methodology**:<br/> In the individual project I've made and Integration tests, to test new features from the userstories. <br/> To apply static code analysis I use SonarCloud, which can detect bugs, code smells and more.<br/> We apply code reviews in the group project which are required before branches can be merged into main. 
|Agile Method|proficient|In the group project we use Scrum to work together as a team on our project. Over this semester we've applied things like, sprints, sprint reviews, daily standups, retrospectives, backlogs, and Jira as our scrum tooling. <br/> As a team we've worked together on creating userstories, and refining them so we can balance our workload in a sprint to bring the product to the Product Owners.|
|CI/CD|proficient|I've implemented a complete CI/CD, which automatically builds when new commits are pushed to a branch. When branches are merged into main, a docker image will be created.|
|Cultural differences and ethics|Proficient|**Recognize**: <br/> During this semester I have learned to recognize the different cultural values and expections from our product owners, and within our own group. <br/><br/> **Take into account**: <br/> I have learned to better understand the cultural values from people within my team, teachers and product owners. Being able to understand these values more, allows for better collaboration and communication. <br/><br/> **Ethics**: <br/>I've adressed the issue of ethics within programming, and how ethical guidelines like the ACM can help people make better ethical decisions.|
|Requirements and design|proficient|**Analyze Requirements**: <br/> We've analyzed requirements from the product owners and turned them into user stories. <br/><br/>**Elaborate designs**: <br/> The architectual designs made for the GP are documented and explained. UI designs were made to help with building a good UI/UX, and getting feedback from stakeholders before implementing new features. <br/><br/>**Validate**: To validate the user stories we completed, we've applied user acceptance testing. And we used feedback from stakeholders and teachers to validate and improve our product. |
|Business process|proficient|**Analyze and descripe business processes**: <br/> We've made a Business Process Model and Notation about the business flow of our Group Project.|
|Professional|proficient|**Professional manner**:<br/> During this semester I've worked together with a group of 6 peoples on the GP. To make sure you can work together effecively as a team, I've learned the importance of communication within the team, and the communication between the team and the product owners. We've set up a code of conduct and a group contract to clarify expectations of each other in the team.   |
