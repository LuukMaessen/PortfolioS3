# Requirements and design
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques*

## Analyzing Requirements
In our group project we have received a paper from our product owners explaining the project, and what they expect us to make.
Together with the group members we have analysed the requirements of the project and reconstructed them into user stories. These user stories, can then be put into our sprints and can be implemented into our project.
Userstories and sprints are a part of our [Agile methology](https://github.com/LuukMaessen/PortfolioS3/blob/main/Proof/agile-method.md)

## Eleborate designs
In our group project we use Figma to make designs on our user interface. This way we are all on the same page when implementing new features. And this way we can also discuss our ideas on building the application with the Product Owners. 

In the Individual Project I have made an [architectural design]().

An important note about the designs is that they are always dynamic.

## Test Techniques
To make sure we are holding ourselves to the requirements of the product owners, we try to consistently get feedback on the product we are building.
A part of getting this feedback comes from user acceptance testing, this means we let people use our product, and get feedback from them about the User Experience.
This usually happens within our developement group when we let each other try our new implementations, but we also try get feedback from our product owners and teachers.
