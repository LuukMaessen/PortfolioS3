# Agile method 
*You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*

## What is Agile?
> In software development, agile practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s), adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the problems to be solved. [Wikipedia Agile software developement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

Agile was popularized in 2001, with the [Manifesto for Agile Software Developement](https://agilemanifesto.org/), in which they wrote [twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of Agile Software, all deriving from these main values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile is one of the most populair approaches to project management. However, there are different frameworks, each have different focusses. Well known agile frameworks include, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, DSDM, XP, FDD and Crystal. 

## Scrum implementation in group project
In the [group project](https://github.com/IOGPS3) we make use of the Scrum Framework.
Scrum is an Agile Framework, that focusses on delivering small pieces of a product at a time. And by continuously experimenting and gathering feedback, to work as effectively as possible.

### Roles
We assigned one person in our team as **Scrum Master**, switching each sprint, they uses the scrum framework to help the team work as effectively as possible.
The **Products Owner** in our case are 2 people from the company IO, their role is communicate about the product goal and set priorities about the backlog items.
The rest of the team (in our case including the Scrum Master) are the **Developers** in the Scrum Team, who work together to create the product.

### Scrum Events
Our team works in **sprints**, which are short cycles of around 3 weeks, in which we work towards the sprint goals.
The goals for each sprint are made during the **Sprint Planning**, which takes place before the start of a new sprint.
Every day we hold **Daily Stand-ups** in which we inspect the progress towards the sprint goals, and possible problems that have arised .
At the end of each sprint, we have a **sprint review** where our team, presents the accomplishments of that sprint to the stakeholders.
And at last we have the **Sprint Retrospective**, during this event, the scrum team comes together to talk about how last sprint went, and identify what went well, and what could be improved.

### Scrum Artifacts
We have a **Product Backlog**, which contains all the features that are needed to create and improve the product.
This product backlog is continuously changing as the project goes on. Then during the sprint planning, we estimate the amount of workload the team can take, and put items from the product backlog, in the **Sprint Backlog**, accordingly.

## Scrum tooling
Using the right tools can make your work a lot easier. At the beginning of our project we had considered different tools like Trello, and GitHub Projects.
Eventually we chose to use Jira, as it is widely used by professional teams, and it also allows us to integrate our tasks with our GitHub Repositories.

The backlog contains the user stories, and tasks that come with it.
