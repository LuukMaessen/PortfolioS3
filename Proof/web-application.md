# Web application
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*

## User Friendly
Something that is user friendly can be described as easy to use, learn and understand.
For most (web)applications this is a very important aspect to the user experience (UX), as you generally want your users to have an easy time while using your product.

To ensure the user friendliness in my projects, I have used the following techniques so far:
- **Peer feedback**
- **Taking inspiration and ideas from other applications**

Peer feedback is great because other students usually see things that you didn't see yourself. Since I am working together in the Group Projects peer feedback is happening all the time.

Taking inspiration from other applications is also important when designing our UI/UX. In most cases it's better to ~steal ideas~ take inspiration from other applications, then to make a very bad UI/UX yourself.

## Full-stack
### What is full-stack developement?
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) has the following description of a full stack developer:
>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
>In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
>- Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
>- Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
>- Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

Both the individual and group project are fullstack because we are building the front-end software, as well as the back-ends that communicates with databases or other services.

### Fullstack projects
Under here you can find all the repositories for both the individual and group project.
These include Frontend and Backend projects.

## Important Questions
### What is the difference between JavaScript and a JavaScript framework?
Javascript is the programming language. A Javascript framework is a collection of code libraries that makes developing your application easier and faster.


### What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a JavaScript framework?
Using a Javascript Framework you can write your application, faster, and easier. You don't need to reinvent the wheel because it's already been done by other people.
Frameworks can give your application a better structure, and are easier to debug and test.
A disadventage is that frameworks do have limitations, altough they are highly customizable, there is an end to how much you can change.
Frameworks can come with a lot of features that are not necessary for your application, this can slow down performance. 

### What are some recent popular JavaScript frameworks?
Some populair Javascript frameworks are Node, Vue, Angular, Ember and React

### What were the specific reasons for choosing your JavaScript framework?
In our case ReactJS felt like a good framework (individual and group project) because it's a very populair framework, and has a big community around it.
It allows you to seperate code into components that you can reuse in your application, making everything much more efficient.

### Can you name and demonstrate some best practices within your JavaScript framework of choice?
Creating many, small components makes your application more flexible and easy to change. 
Organizing files related to the same component in one folder, helps keeping an overview of the project, and makes adding new changes easier.

### What does UX mean?
User Experience

### What are common practices within UX to match the expectation of your user target group?
Letting someone from your target group actually use your application and get feedback from them.
Finding UX designs of other applications that have the same user target group.

### What are some examples of techniques to analyze your UX expectations?
First you need to define who/what your end-user is.
Then you need to start thinking about what these end-users need, and how you can satisfy those needs with your UX design.

### What are some examples of techniques to test your UX expectations?
Have end-users test your application without any instructions. Ask yourself, is the user using your application in the way you intended? What changes are necessary to make the user experience better for this person.
