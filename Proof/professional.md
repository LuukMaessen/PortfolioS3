# Professionalism
*You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.*

## Professionalism towards the stakeholders
To show our professionalism to the stakeholders of our project, we try to focus a lot on good communication.
Besides the communication we have during the sprint reviews, or in between sprints, we also try to keep the stakeholders up to date on the state of our project before any sprint review. This way the stakeholders know what to expect during the sprint reviews, and won't have any suprises about our progress.

When we plan to meet (online) with our Product Owners, we always plan in a meeting on Teams, this way they will have our meetings in their schedules.

Another important aspect of our professionality with the stakeholders lies with Agile, and how we use it as a team. You can read more about our [Agile Process here](https://github.com/LuukMaessen/PortfolioS3/blob/main/Proof/agile-method.md).

## Professionalism within the group
In order to work professionally within our group, we have [set up a collaboration contract]() and also a [defenition of done]() and a [defenition of ready]().
The code of conduct is a series of rules, to make sure we can work together as smoothly as possible regarding our software developement.
The group contract, is a series of rules, in which we have described our roles within the team, and also some rules about working together.

The reason we've set up these documents is so we can work together better, and everyone knows what to expect from each other.


## Research papers
During this semester I've worked on 2 research documents.
You can view the [Research Documents Here](https://github.com/LuukMaessen/PortfolioS3/blob/main/Documentation/ResearchDocuments.md).

Some feedback I've gotten was that it's important to keep research papers written in the third person. Doing this makes the research paper more professional.

## Feedback
Getting feedback about the proccess you've made is important to keep on the right track.
For this reason I asked for feedback when i felt it was needed from teachers, and also other students in my class.
I keep track of the feedback talks with my teachers through Feedpulse (a tool to track multiple feedback moments over time). After I've gotten feedback from a teacher, I write some notes on what we talked about, then the teacher can comment and give a smiley based on the progress I've made.
