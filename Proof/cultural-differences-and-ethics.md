# Cultural differences and ethical aspects
*You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.*

## Recognition and taking into account of cultural differences and ethical aspects
Recognition and awareness of cultural aspects can be a great help in the Software Engineering business. 
In order to create a product that satisfies the stakeholders, you need to be aware of the cultural expectations they might have.

### Cultural expectations Product Owner
Over the course of this semester I have noticed several cultural expectations our Product Owners have.
They put a lot of value on good communication, this is important for them because having good communication will save the product owners a lot of time and money. 
This is why we put a lot of effort in our Group Project on communicating with the product owners. 
We are aware that our product owners like to be kept informed about the status of our project, and they don't like suprises during the Sprint-Reviews.
In order to keep them informed we always contact them as soon as something turns up to prevent suprises.

### Group culture
We also have a certain culture within our Group Project. Within our group we have our own ways of communicating, and have certain expectations of each other. To maintain more clarity on these expectations of each other, we set up a few rules for everyone like the code of conduct and a group contract, you can read more about those [here](https://github.com/LuukMaessen/PortfolioS3/blob/main/Proof/professional.md#professionality-within-the-group).

## Ethical Programming Guidelines
### What are ethics?
> moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity.

### Why are ethics in software engineering important?
Ethics in software engineering are important, because the products we build are used world-wide by billions of people.

### The ACM Guidelines
> The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society. It has its own Code of Ethics and another set of ethical principles that were also approved by the IEEE as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering. [Wikipedia - Programming Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics)

Here you can find the [ethical principles](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) by the ACM.
